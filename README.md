- 👋 Hi, I’m @rooted92
- 👀 I’m interested in learning web3 technologies, end-to-end website development, and collaborating with people on projects that can help humanity.
- 🌱 I'm currently a web developer performing freelance work for local businesses in my community.
- 💞️ I’m looking to be a part of something big, where my work can make a difference, from making websites accessible to improving functionality, to designing scalable software. No matter how big or small I just want to code.
